# Getting Started
## DB connectivity
You must [download and install PostgreSQL Command Line Tools](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) in order to connect to a shared remote database, or run your own PostgresSQL Server to run your own database.

You also need to add the PostgreSQL command line tools to your `PATH` environment variable. We currently use PostgreSQL 17 command line tools, so add `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\` to `PATH`. [Windows Example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72840768/1873164).
